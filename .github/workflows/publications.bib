   abstract = {Gas identification plays a critical role in characterizing our (chemical) environment. It allows to warn of hazardous gases and may help to diagnose medical conditions. Miniaturized gas sensors, and especially those based on chemiresistive detection mechanisms, have gained rapid development and commercialization in the past decades due to their numerous advantageous characteristics, such as simple fabrication, easy operation, high sensitivity, ability to detect a wide range of gases, and compatibility with miniaturization as well as integration for portable applications. However, they suffer from a remarkable limitation, namely their low selectivity. Recently, machine learning-driven approaches to enhance the selectivity of gas sensors have attracted considerable interest in the community of gas sensors, increasing the analyte gas identification ability. In this chapter, firstly, we introduce the general approaches to enhance the selectivity of gas sensors implemented by machine learning techniques, which consists of the architecture scheme design of gas sensors (sensor array and single sensor architecture), the selection of gas sensing response features (steady-state feature and transient-state feature), and the utilization of gas sensing signal modulation techniques (sensing materials modulation, concentration modulation, and temperature modulation). Afterward, a specific application case using a machine learning-enabled smart gas sensor for the identification of industrial gases (PH3 and NH3) is presented, which is based on a single-channel device and utilizes multiple transient features of the response. We believe machine learning in combination with efficient sensing signal modulation techniques could be a feasible way to gain the gas identification capability of gas sensors.},

   abstract = {The Internet of Things era has promoted enormous research on sensors, communications, data fusion, and actuators. Among them, sensors are a prerequisite for acquiring the environmental information for delivering to an artificial data center to make decisions. The MXene-based sensors have aroused tremendous interest because of their extraordinary performances. In this review, the electrical, electronic, and optical properties of MXenes are first introduced. Next, the MXene-based sensors are discussed according to the sensing mechanisms such as electronic, electrochemical, and optical methods. Initially, biosensors are introduced based on chemiresistors and field-effect transistors. Besides, the wearable pressure sensor is demonstrated with piezoresistive devices. Third, the electrochemical methods include amperometry and electrochemiluminescence as examples. In addition, the optical approaches refer to surface plasmonic resonance and fluorescence resonance energy transfer. Moreover, the prospects are delivered of multimodal data fusion toward complicated human-like senses. Eventually, future opportunities for MXene research are conveyed in the new material discovery, structure design, and proof-of-concept devices.},
